# Modular LED Display PCB Project

A custom PCB designed to control LEDs using the Arduino Nano ESP32. LEDs are switched on via digital pin outputs according to pre-set conditions. Project stages included schematic design, PCB layout, stackup definition, and documentation of DRC and BOM.

## Project Overview

- **Aim:**  
  Design a PCB for controlling LEDs with Arduino Nano ESP32 digital outputs.

- **Main Components:**  
  - Arduino headers  
  - LED control circuits  
  - Switch circuit  
  - Decoupling capacitors

## Contents

- `PCB-design/` — PCB schematic and layout files
- `Documentation/` — Images and files: stackup pictures, design rule check (DRC) results, Bill of Materials
- `Technical_Report` — Technical report

## Usage

1. Review `PCB-design/` for electronic design files.
2. See `Documentation/` for analysis images, BOM
