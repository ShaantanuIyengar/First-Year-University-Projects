# Wind Turbine Optimisation

This project explores optimal wind turbine configurations by experimentally testing different combinations of motors, blades, and capacitors to maximise voltage output in a wind tunnel.

## Overview

- Various motor, blade, and capacitor setups were evaluated.
- Voltage output was measured for each combination using a wind tunnel.
- All data was analysed and visualised using MATLAB to identify the most efficient configuration.

## Features

- MATLAB scripts for data processing and graph generation
- Experimental results with visualised voltage outputs
- Project management steps included for reproducibility

## Files Included

- `code/`: Contains MATLAB analysis scripts
- `graphs/`: Output graphs and data visualisations (.png/.jpg)
- `notes%data/`: Project management notes, experimental data

## How to Run

1. Download the MATLAB scripts from the `code/` folder.
2. Run scripts in MATLAB to reproduce the analysis and plots.
3. View `graphs/` for visualised results.
